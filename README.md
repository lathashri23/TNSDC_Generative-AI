Using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for video anomaly detection and reconstruction involves training the VAE on normal video data to learn its underlying distribution. Then, during testing, the model reconstructs the input video frame by frame. Anomalies are detected when the reconstruction error surpasses a predefined threshold, indicating deviations from normal behavior. This method can be effective for detecting anomalies in surveillance footage, industrial processes, and more. Additionally, techniques like incorporating recurrent neural networks or 3D convolutions can enhance the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies in video data.
